# Workflow Guide

This guide outlines a neutral, sample workflow for producing an exposure report.
Adjust the steps to match your tooling and data governance requirements.

## Sample Workflow
1. Collect synthetic exposure inputs from example sources.
2. Validate the inputs against expected formats and completeness checks.
3. Transform the inputs into a unified reporting dataset.
4. Review the draft report for consistency and clarity.
5. Publish the report to an internal distribution channel.

## Checklist
- [ ] Confirm inputs are synthetic and anonymized.
- [ ] Verify timestamps and identifiers follow a consistent format.
- [ ] Document any assumptions or caveats in the report narrative.
