# Project Overview

The exposure report starter is a lightweight scaffold for documenting the
structure of an exposure reporting workflow. It provides placeholders for
narrative descriptions, data definitions, and process checklists.

## Goals
- Offer a clear starting point for describing exposure reporting needs.
- Keep documentation neutral and free from proprietary or real-world data.
- Encourage consistent structure across future extensions.

## Non-Goals
- Shipping production-ready data pipelines or analytics.
- Including identifiable data, customers, or organizations.
